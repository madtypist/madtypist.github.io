## What is this site all about?
I'm one of those kinds of people that Has Thoughts about a lot of things. One of the few things I feel like I have thoughts about that might actually be worth sharing is leadership and management. So, there you go.

## Why am I qualified to talk about this stuff?

I have been told I'm a good manager. I've never had anyone tell me to my face I'm a bad one. I served in the military as an officer, so I've had actual formal training on leadership and stuff.
